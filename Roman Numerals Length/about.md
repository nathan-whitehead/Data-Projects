# What this is

This is just a short project that converts every number in the allowable domain for roman numerals (1-3999) into roman numerals and plots the length of each number by the number of characters. Just a small exercise, but I thought it was mildly interesting. The conversion script to go from integers to a roman numeral string is probably the most useful part of this, but the plot is cool too.
