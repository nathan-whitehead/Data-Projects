# What this is

This is a script which takes in data from MIT on the U.S. House Election results for a given year and compares it to demographic data from the U.S. Census' community survey of the same year.
This script then outputs a set of eight plots to show the relationship between the two and the significance of it (the fit lines are drawn with single  linear regression however the significance is calculated using a multiple linear regression model with all eight variables). There aren't really any crazy conclusions to draw from this that haven't been shown a hundred times elsewhere, but it was a fun project and it was nice to learn about how to access census and elections data. In the future, if I have more ideas, I may return to this and try to show some more interesting results.
